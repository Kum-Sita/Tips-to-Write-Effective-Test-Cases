# Tips-to-Write-Effective-Test-Cases

A strong title, an engaging description, a set of assumptions, and anticipated outcomes are all essential components of a successful test case.

Test cases can be written in a variety of positive and negative ways, but it is essential that they cover all business and functional requirements.

Guidelines for creating quality test cases

* Create test cases with the end user in mind.

* Define the scope and goal of the testing. Determine the testable requirements.

* Domain expertise: A thorough understanding of the requirements is crucial. The quality suffers as a result of incomplete information expanding the potential risks.

* Avoid Making Assumptions: Making assumptions about the features and functionality of a software application could lead to a mismatch between the client's requirements and the finished product, which could hurt the client's business. Follow the specification documents exactly instead. Stick to the scope and specification. A SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document is always better.

* To achieve 100% test coverage, test cases must be written for all software requirements mentioned in the specification document. This will enable the requirement traceability matrix to pinpoint the functions and conditions that weren't tested.

* Updating test cases in accordance with recently introduced changes in the requirements is always a good practice. It is best to update the SRS for major and minor changes.
